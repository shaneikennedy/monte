# A cli tool for generating monte carlo simulations of stocks

### python 3.6 <= needed

### Install dependencies
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

* This program outputs a line comprised of the highest probability outcome for each day
* As of right now matplotlib does not play nicely with virtual environments, so consider running this in a container
